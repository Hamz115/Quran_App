- Teachers can toggle publish status per class

### Student-Specific Mistakes

## Phase 5: QPC Font Rendering & Page Layout Fixes

**Status:** Complete

### QPC (Quran Printing Complex) Fonts
- Page-specific fonts from King Fahd Glorious Quran Printing Complex
- 604 individual font files (QCF_PXXX.woff2) - one per page
- Glyph codes from Quran.com API v4 (code_v1 field)
- Renders exactly like printed Madina Mushaf
- Data source: `https://api.quran.com/api/v4/verses/by_page/{page}?words=true`
- Font source: `https://github.com/mustafa0x/qpc-fonts` (mushaf-woff2)

### Page Layout Fixes
- Fixed line number issues on 20+ pages where ayahs appeared at wrong position
- Pages fixed: 144, 534, 565, 568, 570, 576, 584-599
- Line numbers in JSON control vertical position (`l` field: 0=top, 15=bottom, 16-18=overflow)
- Pattern: Overflow ayahs moved from top (line 1-3) to bottom (line 16-18)

### Font Overflow Fix (Page 586)
- Some ayahs have glyph codes (>= 0xFC00) belonging to previous page's font
- Solution: Load both current AND previous page fonts
- Apply previous page font to overflow glyphs in QuranReader.tsx

### Display Improvements
- Aspect ratio 14/20 (matching real Mushaf proportions)
- Max width 645px for page container
- Font size: `clamp(16px, 3.5vw, 28px)` for most pages
- Fixed text clipping by changing overflow:hidden to overflow:visible
- Content padding: 5% top/bottom, 3% left/right

### Decorative Border (Optional)
- Border.png image with transparent center
- Can be overlaid on mushaf page
- Currently disabled but asset available in src/assets/

**Status:** Complete

### Character-Level Mistakes
- Click word to open popup with: Whole Word, Letters, Harakat options
- Letters and harakat displayed separately for precise marking
- Shadda + following vowel grouped together
- Mistakes stored with `char_index` (null = whole word, N = specific character)

### Mistake Rendering Styles
- **Whole word mistakes** (`mistake-X`): Background gradient + bottom border
- **Letter mistakes** (`letter-mistake-X`): Same style as whole word (background highlight)
- **Harakat mistakes** (`haraka-mistake-X`): Text color change only (no background)
- Color levels: 1x amber, 2x blue, 3x orange, 4x purple, 5x+ red

### Mistake Summary Sections
- **"Mistakes in this class"**: Shows mistakes with occurrences in current class (green border)
- **"Mistakes from previous classes"**: Shows mistakes with occurrences in other classes (gray border)
- Same mistake can appear in BOTH sections if made in multiple classes
- Count shows total error_count across all occurrences

### Classroom UI Updates
- Matches QuranReader styling (aspect ratio, font size, padding)
- Mushaf page container with proper proportions
- Character-level mistake popup with letter/harakat selection
