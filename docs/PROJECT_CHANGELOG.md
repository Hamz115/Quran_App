## Phase 3: Classes & Mistakes Multi-User Integration

**Status:** Complete

### Class Ownership & Visibility
- Teachers own classes (`teacher_id` foreign key)
- Classes support multiple students (group halaqah) via `class_students` junction table
- Classes hidden by default (`is_published = false`)
- Students only see published classes they're part of
- Teachers can toggle publish status per class

### Student-Specific Mistakes
- Mistakes now belong to specific students (`student_id` foreign key)
- Teachers record mistakes for individual students during class
- Students can only view their own mistakes (privacy enforced)
- Same word can be a mistake for different students

### New API Endpoints
- `PATCH /api/classes/{id}/publish` - Toggle class visibility
- `POST /api/classes/{id}/students` - Add students to class
- `DELETE /api/classes/{id}/students/{student_id}` - Remove student from class
- All class/mistake endpoints now require authentication
- Role-based filtering (teachers see their classes, students see published classes)

### Frontend Updates
- TeacherClasses: Student selection when creating class, publish toggle
- StudentClasses: Shows only published classes student is part of
- Teachers see which students attended each class
- Privacy: Students never see other students in class or their mistakes
